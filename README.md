## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Explain that *Interface Builder* allows developers (themselves!) to create interfaces for applications using a graphical user interface (GUI). 
* Navigate to *Interface Builder* from Xcode.
* Explain that a `.storyboard` file is single file in Xcode that shows the flow of the various screens that will make an app. 
* Can navigate to the Development Info section after selecting their target in the Project navigator and recognize that the Main Interface selection is the `.storyboard` file which is the entry point of their app. 


## What the student can do at this point 

* Has a general overview of Xcode and is able to create a new project.
* Knows where to locate the testing file within Xcode.

## Outline / Notes

*  Take the student through what it is I outlined above in the Learning Objectives with screenshots and explanations.
* The next reading will go into detail of how to drag a `UIViewController` over to the empty canvas, so it's not required that you explain this or even show that to the student in this readme unless you think it would be silly not to show them this at this time (I'm fine either way).
